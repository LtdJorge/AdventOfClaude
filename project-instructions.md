We will be resolving Advent of Code 2024 in Rust. For each day you are asked to implement, assume the implementation to
be in a separate subcrate named day1, day2, etc. with a workspace root crate called advent-of-crust having all subcrates
inside a "days" folder. The folder where the input text will be provided is called input, inside the root workspace, and
the files called input1.txt, input2.txt, etc.
