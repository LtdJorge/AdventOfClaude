# AdventOfClaude

Claude Sonnet solves AoC 2024

For my own Rust solutions see [AdventOfCrust](https://github.com/LtdJorge/AdventOfCrust/)

- The Claude project instructions are in [project-instructions.md](./project-instructions.md)
- The only prompts are a copy and paste of the problem statement from `--- Day N: Name ---`
  to just before `Your puzzle answer was <answer>.`
- Implementations are not modified in any way, they are a verbatim copy and paste of Claude's output, unless for purely
  cosmetic warning resolutions, like moving the tests module after the main function.
- Implementations are not guaranteed to compile. Following is a table with the results, a `Day N Part M` solution either
  doesn't compile, compiles but isn't correct or is correct.
- Specific instructions given by Claude like creating a file or editing a prior solution are always followed

## Results

| Day | Part | Result                                      |
|-----|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1   | 1    | Correct                                     |
| 1   | 2    | Correct                                     |
| 2   | 1    | Correct                                     |
| 3   | 1    | Correct                                     |
| 3   | 2    | Correct                                     |
| 4   | 1    | Correct                                     |
| 4   | 2    | Correct, but removes the results for part 1 |
| 5   | 1    | Correct                                     |
| 5   | 2    | Correct                                     |
